Thanks for visiting my portfolio!

```

ðŸ‘‰ Just replace:
- `https://your-portfolio-link.netlify.app` with your **real Netlify URL**  
- Your **email, LinkedIn, GitHub**  

Do you want me to make this **shorter and more recruiter-friendly** (highlighting your skills/projects first), or keep it **detailed for developers**?
```
